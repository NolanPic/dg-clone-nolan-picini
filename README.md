This is a recreation of the [Desiring God](https://www.desiringgod.org/) homepage, for fun.

Used:

- Next.js
- CSS modules
- Motion (animations)
- Static rendering

The aim was not to be pixel perfect, and there are lots of small inconsistencies. The original site doesn't use `box-sizing: border-box` everywhere, and I do in this, so there were some challenges in getting some widths the same.

I limited my time on this exercise, but given more time, I would have set up an actual backend API to serve articles and improved overall accessibility.

Use `npm run dev` to run!
