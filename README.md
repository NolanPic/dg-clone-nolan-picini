This is a recreation of the [Desiring God](https://www.desiringgod.org/) homepage, for fun.

Used:

- Next.js + Typescript
- CSS modules
- Motion (animations)
- Static rendering

In addition to the above, the aim of the project was to use modern CSS, and not to be pixel perfect. For example, as far as I can tell, the DG homepage doesn't use CSS grid, or `box-sizing: border-box` on all elements. I do both, and so there are some inconsistencies.

I limited my time on this exercise, but given more time, I would have set up an actual backend API to serve articles and improved overall accessibility.

Use `npm run dev` to run!
